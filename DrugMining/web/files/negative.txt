drug was given to my 69 yr. old father and on the second dose he seizured, lost consciousness and almost died. Medication was prescribed for his prostatitis. This drug should be taken off the market by FDA.
Horrible drug! It took me 18 months to recover physically and mentally from the effects of cipro. My tendons hurt, I could barely walk for a while, I had anxiety and depression issues, peripheral neuropathy and more. Eventually I recovered but it was a horrible journey. 
I've been taking celexa for about 5 years and it has done wonders to my mood. Unfortunately for me, my body stopped reacting to the drug, and I was forced to start a different SSRI because it no longer functioned for me.
I think this medicine has made me more jittery or nervous than before starting. I am ready to rip someones head off. If anyone reads this please let me know if it is just me or the meds.
Sorry I had to rate this drug low but it is required! 30 days of once daily dosing is `$900. Who can afford that? I can't!! We do not qualify for any of the assistance programs/ Personally I think this is PURE GREED on the part of Bristol-Squib.They can charge anything they want. I have suffered chronic major depression for years, was excited about trying this drug but only got more depress
Not worth trying! not useful. costly 
This medicine is terrible prescribed for depression. Inability to have an erection. Weight gain , insomnia, not able to stay still.Stay away from this crap.
Without medication I normally have terrible interrupted sleep, so i tried Atarax. With 50mg one hour before bed I slept for 10 hours but didn't want to get up.
Muscle and bone aches with loss of memory. Wish I could afford a great attorney to sue the company.
this is the worst drug, I don't recommend it to any one. You get sick, stomach aches, headaches and gas and when you stop you will hurt for a week or more.
5 Day!!! I am having severe lower back pain, almost unbearable!!! I am done with Lipitor!
i stopped using this drug because of the many adverse side effects that are noted. also i have developed sore muscles in my legs
I tried to give it time but the terrible way it affected my body was not me!!! Therefore I am not taking any.
I took this medication for Trigeminal Neuralgia but hit the max dosage of 3600 mg a day & pain eventually grew too mcuh. Moved overt to Topamax.
Withdrawal has been a nightmare. I was given this drug for 6 weeks due to sinusitis and bronchitis. I can't sleep, can't stop shaking, and feel depressed. Never again!
I GAINED 50 POUNDS BEING ON THIS DRUG FOR 2 YEARS. I LOST ALL OF IT AFTER STOP TAKING IT IN 6 MONTHS. HORRIBLE DRUG MADE DIABETES WORST
did not relieve anxiety
Worked almost right away, walked down stairs without pain.
 I tend to anger quicker, nothing that can't be controlled.This is a bad drug not to be used.
This drug stopped working.Not good to use.
While having this drug I feel so low & down & zombified. Can't make decisions, just numb.
This drug is bad it worsen my pain.bad medicine not to take.
This drug is bad and its side effect is terrible.
Don't use this drug. you will suffer alot.
Bad drug you will suffer.
Adjurn drug.
suffer and suffer
It was horrible, I went through all the side effects, I had 51 of them. The worst was I completely had a different personality. And it wasn't a good personality at all.
Severe depression. Massive swelling that impaired my ability to walk, major brain fog, balance issues, dizziness It's a HORRIBLE drug!
Since taking this drug for pain I have been left with numbness that is not going away!!!This is more disturbing than the pain!!
THE ONLY BAD SIDE EFFECT I BELIEVE IS CAUSED BY THIS DRUG IS HAIR BREAKAGE AND LOSS.THE GREAT SIDE EFFECT IS WEIGHT LOSS.
Contracted loss of memory both new and old. Could not retrieve the correct words to use. Frustration from non-communication ease. Suicidal thoughts daily after a short period.
Used after operation for broken arm. Pretty useless to relieve pain. Prescribed by doctor.
My tummy is killing me
severe back pain caused by prolong scolosis of back all forms of meds spinal fusion injections anfd all fforms of rx for pain and ease bak pain to no avail
I hate it so much. Don't take this stuff.
Not strong enough....also caused severe Nausea
Didn't work for me, but as a sleeping pill I'd give it a 5. The plus side to this medicine is that its non addictive.
didnt help at all even at 75 mgs
This medicine is overpriced and makes it hard for me to breath. I take 10mg of this a day. Weight gain and no sex drive. Feel worthless because of this medicine. Doctor said this the best medicine out there.
My menstrual cycle was shorter than normal and more painful. This medication makes me stupid and I forget things and I am slower to process and understand complex discussions. I am stoping this medication immediately. It did help with the allergies but the side effects are make it not worth it
I had an allergic reaction to the drug, resulting in severe rash and hives all over my body.
This drug is evil. I had reocurring uti's every month for about a year. Each time was put on cipro. It knocked out the infections but I was worthless for a year with foggy head, dizziness, heat pounding, skin lesions, horrible g.i. Problems, and muscle and joint pain. I just had a round of cipro last month for a uti and those same symptoms came rushing back. It has been a month since that dose and i'm still dealing with the side effects.
I had never experienced such terrible feelings before as when I took one 180mg tablet. Maybe the dosage was high, but I don't think that a common drug lime Allegra should make you experience anything close to what I experienced. Stay away.
I had taken Allegra for about a month when my system went crazy. I couldn't breath and got weaker every day. I felt like I was having a panic attack and would wake up with my heart just pounding. Itched all over, but especially my face and head. I was ready to go to the emergency room when I finally figured it out. Really scary. Got off and feel better within two days.
I would never take this medicine again.
unstaisfactory
Barely minimizes the pain.
I felt drugged. Freaking feeling. No pain but totally dizzy, upset stomach, when I closed my eyes I saw crazy things. I will never take this again.
Itching, nausea, constipation, dizziness, and nightmares!! Awful!
Don't go down this road!
Had neck surgery. Hardly knew I was on it. Did not relieve pain.
It doesn't seem to work at all could it be fake
It doesn't relieve my pain
Had foot surgery. It would do some pain relief for about an hour. Have been suffering all night
Very unsatisfactory side effects.
Better no to use this drug.

does not last full 24-hours for me. more thoughts of suicide. more thoughts of depression and death
it upsets my stomach and makes me constipated
Helped at first but then noticed I want to sleep all the time.Not caring about anything & have gained 10lbs which is totally not me! I stopped on my own a few days ago & will not take anymore.
bad drug should be pulled of the market. i thought i was going to die. i couldn't walk missed six weeks of work
Have been on it 4 day's still very uncomfortable
Don't ever take this drug! It is a crime it is on the market! Still dealing with heavy pulse, lightheadedness, joint pain, autoimmune issues after 500 days. This drug is toxic to your body and will damage your CNS.
Problems with nausea and indigestion while taking it.
my dr prescribed me celexa about 5 years back in 2009 to treat depression, but i reported its ineffectiveness and that it was causing me agitation. he then put me on ciprolex, with far better results.
